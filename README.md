## Figure 1. Boxplots of association between rs6295, tagged by rs6449693 (Pearl 1,2) or rs358532 (Pearl 3), and delta change in PANSS Total and five subscales in SCZ patients with European ancestry after six weeks of treatment with lurasidone in Pearl1,2 and Pearl3 trials. The Δ change or % change in PANSS Total and five subscales was calculated with last observation carried forward (LOCF). Δ change = PANSSLOCF6wk – PANSSBaseline. % change = Δ change/ PANSSBaseline × 100%.
