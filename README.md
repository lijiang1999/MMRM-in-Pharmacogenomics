###### Abbreviations: EUR, European-ancestry; AFR, African-ancestry; Psychopathological data was presented as mean ± SE. Clinical trials referred to three six-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter registration trials of lurasidone (Loebel et al, 2013; Meltzer et al, 2011b; Nasrallah et al, 2013). PANSS five subscales, Positive, Negative, Disorganization, Excitement, Anxiety and Depression were based on the five-factor model of SCZ psychopathology (Levine and Rabinowitz, 2007).

#### Table 2. rs6295 (tagged by rs6449693or rs358532) contributes to trajectory of early response to lurasidone in SCZ patients with European ancestry from Pearl1,2 trial.

#### Figure 1. Boxplots of association between rs6295, tagged by rs6449693 (Pearl 1,2) or rs358532 (Pearl 3), and delta change in PANSS Total and five subscales in SCZ patients with European ancestry after six weeks of treatment with lurasidone in Pearl1,2 and Pearl3 trials. The Δ change or % change in PANSS Total and five subscales was calculated with last observation carried forward (LOCF). Δ change = PANSSLOCF6wk – PANSSBaseline. % change = Δ change/ PANSSBaseline × 100%.

#### Figure 2.    Forest plots of the association between HTR1A functional polymorphism, rs6295, and improvement in PANSS negative symptom (2A) and positive symptom (2B) after treatment with antipsychotic drugs in patients with SCZ of European ancestry. This is a summary statistics of the meta-analyses of five independent datasets.
